# Simultaneous inference for monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics 

This repository contains the code for replication of the results in the paper "Simultaneous inference for monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics".

The sub-directory `simulation` contains the codes and results of our simulation scenarios in the main paper and supplement materials. We allocate the codes and results into folders named as their corresponding table or figure as presented in paper. For example, directory `simulation/figure_B.1` contains the code and results for the Figure B.1 in our submitted supplement. Additionally, we provide a `Readme.md` file under directory `simulation/` to help users run the codes on a high-performance computing cluster and summarize the outputs into the tables or figures in our submission.

The sub-directory `empirical_study` contains the data, codes and results of the real data analysis sections in the main paper and supplement materials. We also provide a `Readme.md` under the sub-directory `empirical_study/` to help users reproduce and find out the results in our submission.
